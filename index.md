# About
![](sumanth.jpg "me!"){style="float:right; width:150px; padding:2px; border-radius:10%"}
I am a researcher with more than twelve years of experience in automated reasoning and system software development. My broad research focus is on solving software engineering problems through learning and logic.

I did my Ph.D. under the guidance of [Deepak D'Souza] at IISc. During my Ph.D., I worked on synthesis of program proofs that help in formal verification of programs using abduction and SMT solving ([thesis]). I was fortunate to have closely collaborated with [Kumar Madhukar] and [Grigory Fedyukovich] during this period. I did my master's from Chennai Mathematical Institute, where my thesis was done under [Mandayam Srivas]. Long before that, I was a network-based storage system developer at NetApp for five years.
