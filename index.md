# About
![](sumanth.jpeg){style="float:right; padding:2px; border-radius:10%"} I am learning the art and craft of program verification and synthesis at [IISc] (a Ph.D. student) and [TRDDC] (a researcher). My guide at IISc is [Deepak D'Souza] and Kumar Madhukar at TRDDC. I often collaborate with [Grigory Fedyukovich]. I did my master's from Chennai Mathematical Institute, where my thesis was done under [Mandayam Srivas]. Previously, I was an operating system developer at NetApp for five years.

At present, I am working on solving constrained Horn clauses - an intermediate representation for programs and other tasks  - using its syntax and semantics. For more details: ![](email.png "contact"){ width=40% }
